# Devesh Ojha â€” GitHub Pages Redirect

This repository hosts **GitHub Pages** for the user site. It instantly forwards to the live portfolio:

**https://devesh-ojha-portfolio.b12sites.com/index**

## How it works
- `index.html` uses both JavaScript and a meta refresh to redirect.
- The `<link rel="canonical">` helps search engines understand the destination.

## Update the destination
Edit `index.html` and replace the `target_url` everywhere with your new site URL, commit, and push.
